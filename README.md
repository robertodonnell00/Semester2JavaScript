# Semester 2 JavaScript Assignment

For this assignment, I had the task of creating a website for a business of my choice. I decided to create a website for my band, Lady Troffea. This project was a part of Web Development 2, and I received a final grade of 75%.

I utilized a combination of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and JQuery to develop the website, incorporating several key features.

## Index

On the index page, visitors will find a brief description of the band along with an image of "Lady Troffea." Additionally, there is a button labeled "Contact Us." Clicking this button triggers a dropdown menu, enabling users to reach out to the band for booking a gig or making inquiries. It's important to note that this information is only sent to the console. After submitting the information, a pop-up confirmation will appear.

## Members

The Members page provides brief descriptions of each band member. Each member's information is presented in a card format with a rollover function, causing the card to pop and brighten when hovered over. At the end of the page, you'll also find the email addresses of each member, should you wish to contact them directly.

## Inspirations

This page serves as a repository of information about the bands and artists that have influenced Lady Troffea. Clicking on an image will highlight it, and you can navigate through the images on the page using the arrow keys.

## Upcoming Gigs

The final page displays a table with information about our "upcoming" gigs, including details about where and when we'll be performing. Hovering over the table cells will trigger a color change effect.
